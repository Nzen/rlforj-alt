Roguelike Library For Java

Copyright by Sid D.

See the official [homepage](http://rlforj.sourceforge.net) and [project page on SF](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rlforj/) for the release.

This project just reorganized the layout of the project and added a `pom.xml` to make it easier to use with Maven.
